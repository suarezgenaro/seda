SEDA: Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer
=======================================

SEDA is an open-source Python package for forward modeling analysis of brown dwarfs, giant exoplanets, and low-mass stars. The code compares spectra and/or photometry to modern and widely used atmospheric models by using a Bayesian framework to sample posteriors. Alternatively, the code minimizes the chi-square statistic to find the best model fits.
