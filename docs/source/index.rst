===================================
Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer (SEDA) for Forward Modeling of Ultracool Objects
===================================

SEDA is an open-source Python package for comparisons between observed data and atmospheric models. It compares spectra and/or photometry to modern and widely used atmospheric models for brown dwarfs, giant exoplanets, and low-mass stars. The code uses a *Bayesian* framework to sample posteriors. Alternatively, the code minimizes chi-square to find the best model fit. 

**The SEDA release paper is**
