===================================
SEDA: Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer
===================================

SEDA is an open-source Python package for forward modeling analysis. It compares spectra and/or photometry to modern and widely used atmospheric models for brown dwarfs, giant exoplanets, and low-mass stars. The code uses a Bayesian framework to sample posteriors. Alternatively, the code minimizes the chi-square statistic to find the best model fit. 

**The SEDA release paper is**
