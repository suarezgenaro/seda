SEDA: Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer
===========================================

:math:`\texttt{SEDA}` is an open-source Python package for forward modeling and empirical analyses of spectral energy distributions for ultracool objects, including brown dwarfs, directly imaged exoplanets, and low-mass stars. The code compares observed spectrophotometric data to atmospheric models by using a Bayesian framework to sample posteriors. Alternatively, the code minimizes the chi-square statistic to find the best model fits. SEDA also includes several tools useful for the analysis of spectral energy distributions and a variety of functions to visualize results.
