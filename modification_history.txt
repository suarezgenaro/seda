------------
2024/12/20
Genaro Suárez
	Integrated synthetic photometry module into SEDA.
		Modification history of this function:
			- 2024/05/24: SVO VOTable table is read from a link with the most updated filter parameters
			- 2024/05/09: included VOTable table with all SVO filter zero points
			- 2024/05/07: filter transmissions are read and downloaded from SVO, if not already locally stored
			- 2024/04/20: created a function
			- 2021      : functional code but not as a function
		
	Addition of a plotting function to visualize synthetic fluxes.
